## About Me  
Hello Earth! 🌎
I'm a **Geographer** with a degree from the University of Brasília (UnB) and a Master’s Degree in **Applied Geosciences and Geodynamics**, where I researched urban mobility structures and networks through geospatial analysis.
I have professional experience in Cartography, GIS, spatial databases, and WebGIS systems, always working to transform geographic data into meaningful insights for decision-making.

## 🖥️ Tools I use the most:
- **ArcGIS Pro**
- **ArcGIS Enterprise/Online**
- **QGIS**
- **PostgreSQL/PostGIS**
- **Python**

## 💼 Experience Highlights
- Implemented and managed spatial databases for a institutional WebGIS platform at **UnB**, where I worked as a research support fellow in 2024.
- Created dashboards for spatial data visualization and performed data quality control.
- Provided technical support for implementing geospatial systems and platforms.
- Currently, I provide technical services in GIS and cartography for [**IBAMA**](https://pamgia.ibama.gov.br/home/) via an external contractor.

## ❓ What You’ll Find Here?
This GitHub showcases my projects and research in GIS, geospatial data visualization, and urban analysis. I aim to share practical tools and insights into geographic data processing and spatial analysis.
